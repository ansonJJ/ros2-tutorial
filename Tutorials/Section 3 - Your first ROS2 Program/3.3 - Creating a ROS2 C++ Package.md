# 3.3 - Creating a ROS2 C++ Package

This tutorial guides you through creating a C++ package in a ROS2 workspace, a key step for developing C++-based ROS2 nodes. In ROS2, packages are independent, reusable code units that manage specific functionalities, such as camera control or robot motion planning. This tutorial focuses on creating a C++ package, understanding its structure, and building it, highlighting differences from Python packages (see [3.2 - Creating a ROS2 Python Package](3.2%20-%20Creating%20a%20ROS2%20Python%20Package.md)). It is based on the [ROS2 for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/ros2-for-beginners/) Udemy course and assumes you have a ROS2 workspace set up (see [3.1 - ROS2 Workspace Setup Tutorial](3.1%20-%20ROS2%20Workspace%20Setup%20Tutorial.md)).

## Prerequisites

- **ROS2 Workspace**: A ROS2 workspace (e.g., `~/ros2_ws`) initialized with a `src` directory, as described in [3.1 - ROS2 Workspace Setup Tutorial](3.1%20-%20ROS2%20Workspace%20Setup%20Tutorial.md).
- **ROS2 Installation**: ROS2 Jazzy installed in `/opt/ros/jazzy`. Follow the [official ROS2 installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation.html) if not installed.
- **Development Tools**: Ensure `ros-dev-tools` is installed:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install ros-dev-tools
  ```
- **Terminal**: A `bash`-compatible terminal with the workspace sourced (e.g., via `source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash` in `~/.bashrc`).
- **Visual Studio Code (Optional)**: Recommended for exploring package files, installed via:
  ```bash
  sudo snap install code --classic
  ```
- **Previous Knowledge**: Familiarity with the Python package creation process from [3.2 - Creating a ROS2 Python Package](3.2%20-%20Creating%20a%20ROS2%20Python%20Package.md) for context on package creation.

## Step 1: Navigate to the Workspace Source Directory

ROS2 packages must be created in the `src` directory of your workspace to be recognized by the `colcon` build tool.

1. **Go to the Workspace Source Directory**:
   Navigate to the `src` directory in your ROS2 workspace:
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src
   ```
   Verify existing packages (e.g., `my_py_pkg` from the previous tutorial):
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   Expected output (if you followed the Python package tutorial):
   ```
   my_py_pkg
   ```

## Step 2: Create the C++ Package

Use the `ros2 pkg create` command to create a C++ package with the `ament_cmake` build type.

1. **Run the Create Command**:
   Create a package named `my_cpp_pkg` with the `rclcpp` dependency (the C++ library for ROS2):
   ```bash
   ros2 pkg create my_cpp_pkg --build-type ament_cmake --dependencies rclcpp
   ```

   - **Command Breakdown**:
     - `ros2 pkg create`: Initiates package creation.
     - `my_cpp_pkg`: Package name (use underscores for spaces, e.g., `motion_planning_pkg` for a planning package).
     - `--build-type ament_cmake`: Specifies a C++ package using the `ament` build system with CMake.
     - `--dependencies rclcpp`: Adds `rclcpp` for ROS2 C++ functionality.
   - **Output**: The command creates a `my_cpp_pkg` directory with files and folders, showing logs like “creating folders” and “creating files.” A license warning (e.g., “No license file specified”) may appear, which can be ignored for learning unless publishing.

2. **Verify the Package**:
   Check that the package was created:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   my_cpp_pkg  my_py_pkg
   ```

## Step 3: Explore the Package Structure

The C++ package has a different structure from a Python package, resembling a standard C++ project. Use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to examine it.

1. **Open VSCode in the Source Directory**:
   Launch VSCode from the `src` directory to ensure proper autocompletion and dependency recognition:
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src
   code .
   ```

   **Note**: Always open VSCode from `src` to avoid issues with C++ includes and ROS2 environment variables. Ignore any VSCode extension pop-ups if you already have C++ extensions installed (e.g., `ms-vscode.cpptools`).

2. **Understand the Package Structure**:
   In VSCode, the `my_cpp_pkg` directory contains:
   - **`include/my_cpp_pkg/`**: A folder for header files (`.hpp` or `.h`), typically for class declarations.
   - **`src/`**: A folder for implementation files (`.cpp`), where you’ll write C++ node logic.
   - **`CMakeLists.txt`**: Defines build rules for compiling the C++ code using CMake.
   - **`package.xml`**: A mandatory file specifying package metadata and dependencies.
   - **`resource/my_cpp_pkg`**: A resource folder (not typically modified for beginners).
   - **`test/`**: Contains test files (ignorable for now).

   The `package.xml` file includes:
   - Package name (`my_cpp_pkg`), version, description, and maintainer email (update if publishing).
   - Build type (`ament_cmake`).
   - Dependency tags (e.g., `<depend>rclcpp</depend>`).
   - Additional dependencies can be added via `<depend>` tags.

   The `CMakeLists.txt` file contains rules for building C++ code, such as linking `rclcpp`. You’ll modify it when creating nodes.

## Step 4: Build the Package

Build the package to ensure it’s correctly set up, even without nodes.

1. **Navigate to the Workspace Root**:
   Move to the root of the ROS2 workspace (not `src`):
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws
   ```

   **Important**: Never run `colcon build` in the `src` directory, as it creates misplaced `build/`, `install/`, and `log/` folders, causing errors. If you accidentally do this:
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src
   rm -rf build install log
   ```

2. **Build the Package**:
   Build all packages in the workspace:
   ```bash
   colcon build
   ```
   Or build only `my_cpp_pkg` for efficiency:
   ```bash
   colcon build --packages-select my_cpp_pkg
   ```

   - **Output**: Logs show “Starting >>> my_cpp_pkg” and “Finished <<< my_cpp_pkg,” indicating a successful build. If building all packages, both `my_cpp_pkg` and `my_py_pkg` (if present) are built.
   - **Generated Files**: The build updates `build/`, `install/`, and `log/` in `~/ros2_ws`.

3. **Source the Workspace**:
   Ensure the workspace is sourced to access the package:
   ```bash
   source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
   ```
   If you followed [3.1 - ROS2 Workspace Setup Tutorial](3.1%20-%20ROS2%20Workspace%20Setup%20Tutorial.md), this is already in `~/.bashrc`.

## Step 5: Verify the Package

Confirm the package is recognized by ROS2:

1. **List ROS2 Packages**:
   Run:
   ```bash
   ros2 pkg list | grep my_cpp_pkg
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   my_cpp_pkg
   ```

   ![Package Verification](images/package_verification_cpp.png "Terminal showing my_cpp_pkg in ros2 pkg list output")

If `my_cpp_pkg` appears, the package is correctly set up and ready to host C++ nodes.

## Notes

- **Package Naming**: Use underscores (e.g., `my_cpp_pkg`) for package names, per ROS2 conventions. Avoid spaces or hyphens.
- **License Warning**: The `ros2 pkg create` command may warn about a missing license file. This is ignorable for learning but necessary for publishing (e.g., your repo’s `LICENSE.txt` uses MIT).
- **C++ vs. Python Packages**: C++ packages use `ament_cmake` with `CMakeLists.txt` for building, unlike Python’s `ament_python` with `setup.py`. The C++ structure includes `include/` and `src/`, resembling a standard C++ project.
- **Dependencies**: Additional dependencies (e.g., `std_msgs`) can be added later in `package.xml` and `CMakeLists.txt`.
- **VSCode**: Opening from `src` ensures C++ extensions (e.g., for `rclcpp`) work correctly. Install the C/C++ extension if prompted:
  ```bash
  code --install-extension ms-vscode.cpptools
  ```
- **Build Errors**: Building in `src` creates erroneous folders. Always build in `~/ros2_ws` and remove misplaced folders if needed.

## Next Steps

Your `my_cpp_pkg` package is ready to host C++ nodes. In future tutorials, you’ll:
- Create and compile ROS2 C++ nodes in `src/`.
- Modify `CMakeLists.txt` to include node executables.
- Explore `ros2` commands for C++ package management.
