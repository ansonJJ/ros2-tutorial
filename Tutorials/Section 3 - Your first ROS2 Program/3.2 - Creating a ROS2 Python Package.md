# 3.2 - Creating a ROS2 Python Package

This tutorial guides you through creating a Python package in a ROS2 workspace, a foundational step for developing ROS2 nodes. In ROS2, packages are independent, reusable units of code that organize functionality, such as handling a camera, controlling robot wheels, or planning motion. This tutorial focuses on creating a Python package, understanding its structure, and building it, based on the [ROS2 for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/ros2-for-beginners/) Udemy course. It assumes you have a ROS2 workspace set up (see [3.1 - ROS2 Workspace Setup Tutorial](3.1%20-%20ROS2%20Workspace%20Setup%20Tutorial.md)).

## Prerequisites

- **ROS2 Workspace**: A ROS2 workspace (e.g., `~/ros2_ws`) initialized with a `src` directory, as described in [3.1 - ROS2 Workspace Setup Tutorial](3.1%20-%20ROS2%20Workspace%20Setup%20Tutorial.md).
- **ROS2 Installation**: ROS2 Jazzy installed in `/opt/ros/jazzy`. Follow the [official ROS2 installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation.html) if not installed.
- **Development Tools**: Ensure `ros-dev-tools` is installed:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install ros-dev-tools
  ```
- **Terminal**: A `bash`-compatible terminal with the workspace sourced (e.g., via `source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash` in `~/.bashrc`).
- **Visual Studio Code (Optional)**: Recommended for exploring package files, installed via:
  ```bash
  sudo snap install code --classic
  ```

## Step 1: Navigate to the Workspace Source Directory

ROS2 packages must be created in the `src` directory of your workspace to ensure they are recognized by the `colcon` build tool.

1. **Go to the Workspace Source Directory**:
   Navigate to the `src` directory in your ROS2 workspace:
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src
   ```
   Verify the directory is empty or contains existing packages:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

## Step 2: Create the Python Package

Use the `ros2 pkg create` command to create a Python package with the `ament_python` build type.

1. **Run the Create Command**:
   Create a package named `my_py_pkg` with the `rclpy` dependency (the Python library for ROS2):
   ```bash
   ros2 pkg create my_py_pkg --build-type ament_python --dependencies rclpy
   ```

   - **Command Breakdown**:
     - `ros2 pkg create`: Initiates package creation.
     - `my_py_pkg`: Package name (use underscores for spaces, e.g., `temperature_sensor_pkg` for a sensor package).
     - `--build-type ament_python`: Specifies a Python package using the `ament` build system.
     - `--dependencies rclpy`: Adds `rclpy` as a dependency for ROS2 Python functionality.
   - **Output**: The command creates a directory `my_py_pkg` with several files and folders, along with logs like “creating folders” and “creating files.” You may see a license warning (e.g., “No license file specified”), which can be ignored for learning purposes unless publishing the code.

2. **Verify the Package**:
   Check that the package was created:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   my_py_pkg
   ```

## Step 3: Explore the Package Structure

The newly created package contains files and folders essential for ROS2 functionality. Use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to explore them.

1. **Open VSCode in the Source Directory**:
   Launch VSCode from the `src` directory to ensure proper autocompletion and dependency recognition:
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src
   code .
   ```

   **Note**: Always open VSCode from `src` to avoid issues with imports and autocompletion.

2. **Understand the Package Structure**:
   In VSCode, the `my_py_pkg` directory contains:
   - **`my_py_pkg/`**: A folder with the same name as the package, containing an empty `__init__.py` file. This is where you’ll write Python code (e.g., nodes).
   - **`resource/my_py_pkg`**: A resource folder (not typically modified for beginners).
   - **`test/`**: Contains test files (e.g., `test_copyright.py`), ignorable for now.
   - **`package.xml`**: A mandatory file defining package metadata and dependencies.
   - **`setup.py`**: Configures the package for installation (used later for nodes).
   - **`setup.cfg`**: Additional configuration for package installation.

   The `package.xml` file is critical. It includes:
   - Package name (`my_py_pkg`), version, description, and maintainer email (update if publishing).
   - Dependency tags (e.g., `<depend>rclpy</depend>` for `rclpy`).
   - Build type (`ament_python`).

## Step 4: Build the Package

Even without nodes, you can build the package to ensure it’s correctly set up.

1. **Navigate to the Workspace Root**:
   Move to the root of the ROS2 workspace (not `src`):
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws
   ```

2. **Build the Package**:
   Build all packages in the workspace:
   ```bash
   colcon build
   ```
   Or build only `my_py_pkg` for efficiency:
   ```bash
   colcon build --packages-select my_py_pkg
   ```

   - **Output**: Logs will show “Starting >>> my_py_pkg” and “Finished <<< my_py_pkg,” indicating a successful build.
   - **Generated Files**: The build creates/updates `build/`, `install/`, and `log/` directories in `~/ros2_ws`.

3. **Source the Workspace**:
   Ensure the workspace is sourced to access the package:
   ```bash
   source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
   ```
   If you followed [3.1 - ROS2 Workspace Setup Tutorial](3.1%20-%20ROS2%20Workspace%20Setup%20Tutorial.md), this is already in `~/.bashrc`.

## Step 5: Verify the Package

Confirm the package is recognized by ROS2:

1. **List ROS2 Packages**:
   Run:
   ```bash
   ros2 pkg list | grep my_py_pkg
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   my_py_pkg
   ```

   ![Package Verification](images/package_verification.png "Terminal showing my_py_pkg in ros2 pkg list output")

If `my_py_pkg` appears, the package is correctly set up and ready to host Python nodes.

## Notes

- **Package Naming**: Use underscores (e.g., `my_py_pkg`) for package names, following ROS2 conventions. Avoid spaces or hyphens.
- **License Warning**: The `ros2 pkg create` command may warn about a missing license file. This is ignorable for learning but important if publishing on GitHub (e.g., add a `LICENSE` file like MIT).
- **Dependencies**: Additional dependencies can be added later by editing `package.xml` (e.g., `<depend>std_msgs</depend>`) and `setup.py`.
- **VSCode**: Opening VSCode from `src` ensures proper ROS2 environment integration, especially for Python autocompletion with `rclpy`.

## Next Steps

Your `my_py_pkg` package is ready to host Python nodes. In future tutorials, you’ll:
- Create and run ROS2 nodes within `my_py_pkg/my_py_pkg/`.
- Modify `setup.py` and `setup.cfg` to install nodes.
- Explore additional `ros2` commands for package management.
